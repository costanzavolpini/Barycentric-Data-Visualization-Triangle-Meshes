Making computation per vertex (e.g. \textit{Flat Shading}) is more efficient because in general a models have less vertices than triangles (see Table \ref{table:model-table-vertices}).
For example, the armadillo model has $15002$ vertices and $30000$ triangles, then make calculation per vertex instead of triangle results in half of the computations.

\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}

    Model              & \#vertices & \#triangles \\
    \hline
    Armadillo          & 15002 & 30000 \\
    Eight              & 766 & 1536 \\
    Genus3             & 6652 & 13312  \\
    Horse              & 48485 &  96966\\
    Icosahedron\_1      &  42 & 80 \\
    Icosahedron\_2      &  162 & 320 \\
    Icosahedron\_3      & 642 &  1280
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Making computation per edge would also be more efficient, because edges are shared between $2$ triangles in a mesh.

vertex shading is around half of calculations of triangle shading (more efficient)
