\subsection{Barycentric coordinates}\label{section:barycentric-coord}
Barycentric coordinates, discovered by M\"obius in 1827, represent one of the most progessive area of research in computer graphics and mathematics thanks to the numerous applications in image and geometry processing \cite{REPORT:localbarycentricoordsepfl}.
% ------
The position of any point in a triangle can be expressed using a linear combination of barycentric coordinates:
$$ p = \lambda_1 p_1 + \lambda_2 p_2 + \lambda_3 p_3$$
where $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ are the vertices of a triangle and $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ (the barycentric coordinates) are three scalars that
respect the following barycentric coordinates properties:
% -------
\begin{itemize}
  \item partition of unity: $\sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_{i}(p) = 1$
  \item reproduction: $\sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_{i}(p)p_i = p$
  \item Lagrange-property: $\lambda_i(p_j) = \delta_{i, j}$
  \item linearity: $\lambda_i \in \prod_1$
  \item non-negativity: $\lambda_i(p)\geq 0$ for $p \in [p_1, p_2, p_3]$
\end{itemize}

% -------
A point is inside the triangle if and only if $0 \leq \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \leq 1$. If a barycentric coordinate is less than zero or greater than one, the point is outside the triangle \cite{SLIDE:ICORSI}.
% -------
Barycentric coordinates allow the interpolation of values, from a set of control points over the interior of a domain, using weighted combinations of values associated with the control points \cite{REPORT:localbarycentricoordsepfl}, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:barycentric-coord}.

\subsection{Triangle meshes}
A piecewise linear surface in 3D with triangular faces is called \textit{triangle mesh} (see example in Fig. \ref{fig:mesh-3d-armadillo}). Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a triangle mesh that consists of a geometric and topological component represented by a graph structure with a set of vertices $\mathcal{V} = \{ v_1, ..., v_V \}$ and a set of triangular faces connecting them $\mathcal{F} = \{ f_1, ... , f_F \}$ with $f_i \in \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}$. The connectivity of a triangle mesh can be expressed in terms of the edges of the respective graph $\mathcal{E} = \{ e_1, ..., e_E \}$ where $e_i \in \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}$ \cite{polygonmeshprocessing}.

\subsection{Lighting - Phong lighting model}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/lighting}
\caption{Phong lighting model. $p$ is the point illuminated by the ray ($l-p$). $v$ represents the view position and $l$ the light source \cite{SLIDE:ICORSI}.} \label{figure:lighting}
\end{figure}
Given a light source at position $l$ with intensity $I_l$ and a surface point at position $p$ with normal $n$,
we can define the angle between the light vector ($l-p$) and the normal $n$ as $\varphi$.
Let $r$ be the reflected light vector defined as $r = 2 n \; \cdot <n, l - p> - (l-p)$ and $\alpha$ the angle between that vector and the view direction $(v - p)$ as depicted in Figure \ref{figure:lighting}.

The \textit{Phong lighting model} is defined as the sum of the self-emitting intensity, ambient term, diffuse reflection and specular reflection:
$$ I = I_e + {\rho}_a \cdot I_A + \sum_{j=1}^n ({\rho}_d \cdot cos {\varphi}_j + {\rho}_s \cdot cos_{\alpha_j}^k) \cdot I_j$$ where $I_e$ is the self-emitting intensity, ${\rho}_a, {\rho}_d, {\rho}_s$ are the reflection constants (surface properties), $n$ is the number of lights sources with intensities $I_j$ and $k$ is the shininess \cite{SLIDE:ICORSI}.

\subsection{Linear interpolation}\label{section:linear-interpolation}
Given two numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$ (the start and final values of the interpolant), a linear interpolation can be carried out using a parameter $t\in[0,1]$ (see \cite{WEBSITE:interpolation}):
$$ n = n_1 + t (n_2 - n_1)$$
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \scalebox{0.6}{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \coordinate (n1) at (0.5,0.9);
    \coordinate (n2) at (7.1,0.9);
    \coordinate (t) at (4.1,0.9);
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] at (0,0) {\includegraphics[scale=4.5]{images/interpolation-2.png}};
    \draw (n1) node [below left] {$n_1$};
    \draw (n2) node [below left] {$n_2$};
    \draw (t) node [below left] {$t$};
  \end{tikzpicture}}
  \caption{The further $t$ is from the red point, the more blue we want. The further $t$ is from the blue point, the more red we want.}\label{figure:li-ratio}
\end{figure}
\\
This should be read as the percent of blue color ("length of blue segment/total length") plus the percent of red color ("length of red segment/total length") as shown in Fig. \ref{figure:li-ratio}. In case we want to make an interpolation given three values ($n_1$, $n_2$ and $n_3$), instead of referring to the ratio of lengths, we would use the following equation (\textit{barycentric interpolation)}:
$$ n = \lambda_1n_1 + \lambda_2n_2 + \lambda_3n_3$$
where $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ are the barycentric coordinates.

\subsection{Flat Shading}
\textit{Flat shading} is a way to compute the color at each pixel (at a corner or at the barycentre) using the triangle normal.
Given a triangle $[p_1, p_2, p_3]$, the lighting is computed using the normal $n$: $$\widehat{n} = (p_2 - p_1) \times (p_3 - p_1) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; n = \frac{ \widehat{n} } { ||\widehat{n}|| } $$ at $p= (p_1 + p_2 + p_3)/3$. This color is then used for all pixels of the triangle. Flat shading gives objects with flat facets \cite{SLIDE:ICORSI}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Gouraud Shading}
\textit{Gouraud Shading} is a way to compute the color at each pixel assigning a normal to each corner of a triangle. After having computed the color for each corner it linearly interpolates these color values (see Sections \ref{section:barycentric-coord} and \ref{section:linear-interpolation}).
Given a triangle $[p_1, p_2, p_3]$ and its normal at each corner $n_1, n_2, n_3$, the lighting is computed at $p_i$ using the normal $n_i$. This, applied to each corner, returns the color values $c_1, c_2, c_3$ respectively for $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3$.
These colors are then linearly interpolated $c = {\mu}_1 c_1 + {\mu}_2 c_2 + {\mu}_3 c_3$, where ${\mu}_1$, ${\mu}_2$ and ${\mu}_3$ are the barycentric coordinates. Gouraud shading gives objects that appear more smooth \cite{SLIDE:ICORSI}.
